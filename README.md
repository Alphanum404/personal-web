## About

I built this project primarily to understand how to implement a small and simple website (microservices), and serverless deployment.

Also, I believe this is a cute way to show where you are from or where you built your project, so yeah.

Initial inspiration for the project came from [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/naveenjetty/pen/eBVdez). Badges are generated by [Shields.io](https://shields.io): the code is essentially a wrapper around their [gh-badges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-badges) library.
